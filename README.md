With a diverse background as an educator and manager, I bring extensive experience in software development, having successfully delivered projects for high-profile companies in areas such as warehouse delivery solutions, government websites, Formula 1 strategy content delivery and the NHS going digital. My career is marked by leveraging cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to deliver innovative solutions.

At Songtradr, I contribute to transforming the B2B music industry through innovative technology and creativity. Empowering clients such as Google, Adidas, Netflix, VRBO, and Fenty to grow their businesses and foster positive brand affinity with their audiences through the power of music.

In my role at Bspoke Global Networks Ltd (BGN), I integrated media and data sources to create new content experiences through robust workflows. I contributed to the development of BGN's live media and data streaming platform for prestigious events such as Formula 1, Formula E, MotoGP, and Sky TV. I played a pivotal role in introducing modern data engineering tools and practices and in designing the UI/UX for the main application used in these events.

- Key Achievements: -

Transformed physical, unstructured and legacy records from multiple systems into digital, organised, searchable and shareable content for the NHS.

Delivered a live media and data streaming platform for Formula 1, Formula E, MotoGP and Sky.
Introduced modern data engineering tools and practices, enhancing workflow efficiency.

Designed intuitive UI/UX for applications used in Formula 1 and MotoGP.

Provided mentoring and leadership to the team throughout project execution.

I'm not only passionate about learning new technologies as they evolve, but also about what I do.
