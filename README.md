----------

With many years of experience, I started my career with a software development company creating and maintaining software of all sorts, user and admin-facing, from warehouse delivery solutions to a government job-seeker site.

Since then, I have been delivering solutions for high-profile companies and customers always using the best cutting-edge technologies and methodologies available.

Over the last 5 years, I have been powering the combination of media and data sources and the building of new content experiences for users through a unique powerful workflow. Integrating multiple live data sources, from live HD high frame rate video to high-frequency telemetry and timing with consistent accessible data query APIs.

Key Achievements:

- Pivotal role in introducing modern data engineering tools and practices.

- Pivotal role in designing and creating UI/UX for the main application for *Formula 1* and *MotoGP*. A merge of video streaming and data.

- Leveraged the team, providing mentoring through project execution.

- Moleculer.js source code contributor.

Core Technology Skills:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Python

- React.js, Moleculer.js

- AWS – main AWS cloud services

- Messaging – Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AMQP

- Docker, Kubernetes, Docker-Compose

- CI/CD - Bitbucket pipeline, GitHub Actions

- DB - Mongo, Elasticsearch, SQL (Postgres and MySQL)

- Complex events and streaming data processing

- Microservices

I'm passionate about learning new technologies as they evolve.
