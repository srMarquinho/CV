**Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer**

With a broad background in software development, I’ve delivered projects across diverse sectors, such as warehouse logistics, government websites, digital healthcare and real-time media systems. I focus on using the right tools for the job, avoiding unnecessary complexity, and delivering clean, maintainable solutions. My work often blends cutting-edge tech with a pragmatic mindset.

At Songtradr, I’m helping transform the B2B music space through fast-paced and focused development. We work in a highly collaborative XP-style environment, using practices such as pair programming and TDD. My work is essential in exposing APIs and building out event-based data streams to support music licensing and catalogue access.

Previously at Bspoke Global Networks (BGN), I worked on integrating media (audio/video) and data sources to build tools and workflows for major clients, including Formula 1, Formula E, MotoGP, and Sky TV. I contributed to BGN’s live media and data streaming platform, which supported high-profile broadcast operations. I also introduced modern data engineering practices into the team and designed the UI/UX for the core application used across these clients.

I'm not only passionate about learning new technologies as they evolve, but also about what I do.

## <a name="experience"></a>Relevant Experiences

#### [Songtradr](https://www.songtradr.com/) - London (Remote) - ('24 - current)

At Songtradr, (Bandcamp and MassiveMusic) I work across music-tech platforms. These platforms reach hundreds of millions of users, with systems designed to deliver 99.9%+ uptime and handle high-throughput APIs.

Contributed to the development and maintenance of robust APIs and real-time messaging services using Infrastructure as Code in AWS infrastructure. Built and maintained scalable backend services in Node.js, with occasional contributions in other languages and frameworks and Lit for frontend components. Helped ensure our API services remain responsive and reliable at scale, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams in a fully remote environment.

#### [Mizaic](https://www.mizaic.com/) - Chelmsford (Remote) - ('23 - '24) 1 year

See: [https://www.mizaic.com/mediviewer/](https://www.mizaic.com/mediviewer/)

I helped transform physical, unstructured, and legacy records from multiple systems into digital, organised, searchable, and shareable content. A key part of my work contributed to our environmental goals by advancing paperless processes and helping reduce the carbon footprint across hospital networks.

I worked extensively with TypeScript and JavaScript, primarily using Node.js for backend development and React for frontend applications. My experience also includes designing and implementing GraphQL APIs and integrating them with React clients.

Mentoring junior developers was a rewarding part of the role, helping grow team skills and fostering collaboration.

*Skills:* Redis, GraphQL, REST APIs, React.js, Node.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, MongoDB, Docker, Tailwind CSS.

#### [Bspoke Global Networks Ltd (BGN)](http://bgnevents.com/) - Hove (Hybrid) - ('18 - '23) 5 years and 6 months

See: [https://bgnelements.com/what-is-elements](https://bgnelements.com/what-is-elements)

BGN is where I developed most of my technical skills and experience. I had the rare opportunity to be involved from the ground up, contributing to the architecture of a large-scale software platform. This allowed me to make key technical decisions from early design choices to long-term infrastructure planning that continue to support the platform today.

I designed, developed, and maintained microservices in a distributed, performance-focused environment, deployed across cloud platforms and data centres. My backend work was primarily in Node.js, using modern server-side JavaScript libraries and architecture patterns.

On the frontend, I contributed to the UI/UX design and implementation using React with JavaScript and TypeScript, working closely with both product and editorial teams.

I also worked on-site, supporting high-pressure live operations for major clients, including Formula 1, Formula E, MotoGP, and Sky TV, to help deliver reliable, real-time media and data streams during globally broadcast events.

Other key contributions:
Managed high-volume data with MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
Administered Linux environments and deployed applications with Kubernetes.
Prometheus and Grafana to monitor performance and optimise system resource usage.
Maintained smooth team workflows through Jira, Slack, and documentation tools.

*Skills:* React.js, Node.js, Apache Kafka, TypeScript, JavaScript, Moleculer.js, Kubernetes, Microservices, MongoDB, System Architecture, Test Driven Development, Web Development, Software Development, Back-End Web Development, Front-end Development, Agile Methodologies, Business Strategy, Web Applications, Web Services, Software Documentation, NoSQL, Git, Unix, Python, Docker, ElasticSearch, Continuous Integration, Communication, Linux, HTML, HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Cloud Computing, Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD), MaterialUI.

#### [Elysium](https://elysium.uk/) - Crowborough (On-site) - ('16 - '18) 2 years

As a full-stack developer at Elysium Ltd, I contributed to the full lifecycle of web applications — from design and development to deployment and ongoing maintenance. My work focused on delivering reliable, responsive solutions tailored to the needs of a varied client base.

Designed and developed dynamic web applications and websites using Ruby on Rails, backed by relational databases.

Delivered new features and enhancements while supporting and improving live applications to maintain performance and stability.

Collaborated with clients across multiple industries, adjusting architecture and implementation to suit each unique use case.

Integrated Web Services and APIs to enable seamless communication between system components.
