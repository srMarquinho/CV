Former educator and manager with extensive experience in software development, including warehouse delivery solutions, government websites and Formula 1 strategy content delivery. I have a track record of delivering solutions for high-profile companies, always leveraging cutting-edge technologies and methodologies.

Currently, at Mizaic, I'm revolutionizing the clinician-patient experience by developing an Electronic Document Management System tailored for the NHS. I transform physical, unstructured, and legacy records into digital, organized, searchable, and shareable content.

In my previous role at Bspoke Global Networks Ltd (BGN), I powered the integration of media and data sources, building new content experiences for users through powerful workflows. I contributed to the delivery of the BGN live media and data streaming platform for events like *Formula 1* and *MotoGP*. I played a pivotal role in introducing modern data engineering tools and practices and in designing UI/UX for the main application for *Formula 1* and *MotoGP*. I'm also a Moleculer.js source code contributor.

**Key Achievements:**

- Delivered BGN live media and data streaming platform for *Formula 1* and *MotoGP*.
- Introduced modern data engineering tools and practices.
- Designed UI/UX for *Formula 1* and *MotoGP* applications.
- Provided mentoring to the team throughout project execution.

**Core Technology Skills:**

- Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Python
- Technologies: React.js, Node.js, AWS, Messaging (Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AMQP), Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (Bitbucket pipeline, GitHub Actions), Databases (Mongo, Elasticsearch, SQL), Microservices, Complex events, and streaming data processing.

I'm passionate about learning new technologies as they evolve.
