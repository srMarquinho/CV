----------
An [XP Value](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html) fan, currently working alongside a talented team of experienced programmers, systems administrators and web developers.

A *full-stack* web/software developer. My background combines creativity and lead with a high level of technical knowledge; I love bringing these traits into coding. I have become hugely passionate about writing code that is clean, tested, reusable and easily maintainable.

Having a solid commercial experience and completing the world-leading intensive 12 weeks of Makers Academy, I have grown from an enthusiastic amateur coder into a competent and confident developer.

I'm passionate about learning new technologies as they evolve.

### Skills

**Thrives under pressure and excellent communicator**
- Experience building and supporting high-end production systems for some of the worldâ€™s most advanced customers, including **Formula 1** and **MotoGP**. Also, having experiences as Head of Operations on schools I have earned the confidence and ability to work and get results from working under pressure. At times I had to deal with complaints from parents, teachers and students at the same time and meetings.
- As a developer working on huge and diverse projects is not uncommon to deal with clients and users with "urgent" bugs on production.

**Fast learner and analytical thinker**
- For every workplace I had the honour to join I have been offered new positions and opportunities due to the fast way I was able to learn and adapt to the different situations. Check my <a href="#experience">previous experiences</a>.
- For our [ShopPing project](https://github.com/srMarquinho/shopping-list-app), I learnt Cordova and Rails(API) to build a fully-functioning and fully-tested IOS app in two weeks.
