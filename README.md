----------

Former educator and manager with many years of experience, I began my career at a software development company, where I created and maintained various types of software – both user and admin-facing. These ranged from warehouse delivery solutions to a government job-seeker website.

Since then, I have been delivering solutions for high-profile companies and customers, always utilizing the latest cutting-edge technologies and methodologies.

Currently at Mizaic, I have been revolutionizing the clinician-patient experience at the point of care. I have helped develop an Electronic Document Management System tailored for the NHS. Transforming physical, unstructured and legacy records from multiple systems, into digital, organised, searchable and shareable content.

Previously, for over five years, I powered the integration of media and data sources, building new content experiences for users through uniquely powerful workflows. This involved integrating multiple live data sources, including live HD high-frame rate video and high-frequency telemetry. These were integrated with consistent and accessible data query APIs.

Key Achievements:

- Delivered BGN live media and data streaming platform for precise events such as *Formula 1* and *MotoGP*.

- Pivotal role in introducing modern data engineering tools and practices.

- Pivotal role in designing and creating UI/UX for the main application for *Formula 1* and *MotoGP*. A merge of video streaming and data.

- Leveraged the team, providing mentoring through project execution.

- Moleculer.js source code contributor.

Core Technology Skills:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Python

- React.js, Moleculer.js

- AWS – main AWS cloud services

- Messaging – Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AMQP

- Docker, Kubernetes, Docker-Compose

- CI/CD - Bitbucket pipeline, GitHub Actions

- DB - Mongo, Elasticsearch, SQL (Postgres and MySQL)

- Complex events and streaming data processing

- Microservices

I'm passionate about learning new technologies as they evolve.
